# (Updating) Server manipulation basics for beginners: virtual machine, ssh connection and Ansible

## To begin...

This note is to keep track of my progress learning the basics of server manipulation during my summer as an IT intern for [M-Service](https://momo.vn/). To be able to write this, I want to say thank you, in general, to the whole infrastructure team, the company's committee and HR team for giving me a good first-hand experience in the fintech industry and taking good care of me, and specially to Vinh Vo, who acted as a colleague and a mentor during my internship, and hope that you will find a good girlfriend that suits your enthusiasm well in the future. I hope that you, who are reading this note (probably a new intern guy at Momo), will have fun and enjoy the ride!

### <a name="bkg"></a> Background

By the time I had my internship, I was a beginner to computing, only knowing some basic C and Java, and did not know how to operate on linux terminals. I used Windows as my operating system back then, and my knowledge about systems and servers are plain zero. Unlike what I expected, despite being related, this field does not require prereq coding knowledge, so I belive that as long as you enjoy it, you will get the hang of it ;) .

A bit about my job: The company I worked for, M-Service, is well-known in Vietnam for its online payment application Momo. I worked here in the technology department, in the infrastructure team as a DevOps trainee.

As said above, I used Windows as my operating system. So hectic when it comes to operating systems. It has so many limitations (many operations does not support Windows) that every time I googled to find a solution, another one popped up almost immediately. So I decided to have another machine that operates on ubuntu. There are many ways to solve, imo:

_Buy another PC (not enough money :( )

_Dual boot (you may lose data if you made a mistake)

_**Setting up virtual machine**: I chose this method!

#### How:
VMWare
