# (Updating) Server manipulation basics for beginners: virtual machine, ssh connection and Ansible

## To begin...

This note is to keep track of my progress learning the basics of server manipulation during my summer as an IT intern for [M-Service](https://momo.vn/), department of infrastructure. To be able to write this, I want to say thank you, in general, to the whole infrastructure team, the company's committee and HR team for giving me a good first-hand experience in the fintech industry and taking good care of me, and specially to Vinh Vo, who acted as a colleague and a mentor during my internship, and hope that you will find a good girlfriend that suits your enthusiasm well in the future.
